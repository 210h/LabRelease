    "**Warning: please turn down your speakers before starting work on this section. The audio output can be loud, especially if there are errors in your logic.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound is made of vibrations in the air, which eventually reach your ear. One of the simplest sounds to produce using Python is a sine wave. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to play a sine wave with a frequency of $440 Hz$  for 3 seconds ($440 Hz = 880\\pi \\frac{rads}{s}$). We need some way of telling Python the value $\\sin (880\\pi t)$ for each $t \\in [0, 3]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we obviously cannot specify $\\sin (880\\pi t)$ for every single time in the closed interval, Python instead asks us to give us $\\sin (880\\pi t)$ measurements with evenly spaced values of t. This spacing is called the **sampling period** - the computer asks us for a related quantity, the sampling rate, defined as $\\frac{1}{\\textrm{sampling period}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below code example, you can see how `t` generates these evenly spaced values for sine based on the sampling rate. We then compute $\\sin (880\\pi t)$ for each value of `t`. Finally, we use the 'Audio' function to play this audio using the array of sine values `wave_audio` and the sampling rate `sr`. \n",
